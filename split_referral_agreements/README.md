# Split Referral Agreements

## Description

Carbiz partners with Repairers and Tow Truck Companies throughtout Australia. Whenever a partner refers an client to Carbiz, the partner receives a referral payment based on the referral agreement Carbiz has with the partner. Most of the referral agreements are *Direct* referral agreement, i.e. the referraly payment is given out directly to the repairer or tow truck company. However, there are some partners who wants to split their referral payments with their employee or company. For example, John Doe who works at Bizcar Towing Company, referred us a client. When the client's booking goes on hire, both John Doe and Bizcar will receive the referral payment split between them. The split amount varies from one referrer to another.

## Setting up the Split Referral Agreements

Follow the below steps to set up a split referral agreement. In this example, we are going to set up a split referral agreement for John Doe and Bizcar Towing. Whenever John Doe referred a client to Carbiz, John Doe will receive $100 and Bizcar Towing will receive $400 regardless of the vehicle category.

Make sure that **Agreement Status** is set to **Draft**, **Start Date** and **Agreement Date/Time** is correctly set. Also make sure that the **Primary Account** is assigned to the parent account. John Doe is an employee at Bizcar Towing. Therefore, Bizcar is the parent account.
